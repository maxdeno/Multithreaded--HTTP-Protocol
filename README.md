# Multithreaded-HTTP-Protocol
A simple project that highlights how a server accepts and maintains multiple connections. 
A multithread server handles multiple client request by simultaneously handling multiple threads on the same process.

## âœ¨OPERATION:<br>
When the server receives a TCP connection
request from a client, it will set up the TCP connection through another port and services the client
request in a separate thread. There will be a separate TCP connection in a separate thread for each
request/response pair.

## ðŸš€Features:
- Handles multiple client connections using threads.
- Sends a simple HTML response to each client.
- Easy to set up and run


## ðŸ˜¡Problem encountered:
1. Encoding
   The server could not encode the html file created, since it was not set in the "utf-8" format(string format)<br>
   soln:- adding the format to the file encoding send method. `connection_socket.send("HTTP/1.1 200 ok\r\n\r\n".encode("utf-8"))`
   @ensure the encoding style is uniform across the entire code

## Run the server<br>
  `python web2_server.py 6789`

  
## Accessing the server contents:<br>
  on your browser url, type:  `http://<server_IP_addr>:6789/filename.html`

  
 
 ## PROOF OF CONCEPT:
